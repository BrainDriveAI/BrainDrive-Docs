# How to Contribute

This page should give newcomers a warm welcome and show them how to get involved.

Suggested layout:

- **Start Here** – link to a short orientation or community resource.
- **Contribution Paths** – outline roles like documentation, design, plugin development, etc., with links to GitHub templates or boards.
- **Review & Support** – explain how reviews happen, expected timelines, and where to ask for help.
- **Community Guidelines** – link to any formal policies that live in GitHub.

Keep the tone inviting and point to GitHub for detailed processes.
