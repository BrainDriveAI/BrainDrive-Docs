# Contributing to BrainDrive

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to BrainDrive!

**BrainDrive is an open-source personal AI system designed for ownership, freedom, empowerment, and sustainability.**  
Our mission is to make it easy for anyone to build, control, and benefit from their own AI system—free from Big Tech’s restrictions.

We’re early in our development journey and still laying the foundation. Right now, we’re inviting early technical users to explore, provide feedback, and help shape what’s coming next.

## 🙋‍♂️ Who Should Contribute Right Now?

We're currently in a **developer beta** phase, which means we're:
- Actively updating the core system
- Making changes that may break early plugin or extension development
- Prioritizing **usability**, **feedback**, and **installation experience**

That said, if you’re technically inclined and share our vision, your help is welcome!

## 🚀 What's Coming Soon

We’re just getting started.

Very soon, we’ll be opening BrainDrive up for broader contributions—both to the core system and through plugins. Whether you want to improve the software that powers every BrainDrive or build something brand new that others can use, there’s a place for you here.

In the coming weeks, we’ll share:

- Clear contribution pathways for improving the core system
- Tools and templates to help you build your own plugins
- A plugin marketplace where you can share or sell what you’ve built
- If you're an early contributor, you’re not just writing code—you’re helping shape the future of personal AI.

👉 Follow this repository for updates and be the first to know when contribution paths open up.

## ⚠️ Development Warning

We’re actively improving core components—including the renderer and plugin system.  
That means:
- Features may change rapidly
- Plugin development may be unstable
- Internal architecture may not be final

We're not quite ready for general-purpose contributions or plugin development just yet—but we're getting close.

If you'd like to be notified when the project is ready for wider contribution, keep an eye on the [Forum](https://forum.braindrive.ai) or watch this GitHub repo.

## 🤝 Long-Term Vision

BrainDrive LLC is currently stewarding the project. Our goal is to decentralize over time as the ecosystem matures. Eventually, we want BrainDrive to be built by its owners, builders, and entrepreneurs—not just us.

---

## ✨ Guiding Principles

We evaluate all contributions through the lens of our four core pillars:

- **Ownership** – You own your BrainDrive.
- **Freedom** – We never introduce lock-ins or coercive restrictions
- **Empowerment** – All documentation should make BrainDrive easier for others to use
- **Sustainability** – We prioritize value-creating contributions that help the ecosystem thrive
