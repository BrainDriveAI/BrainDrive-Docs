# Plugin Developer QuickStart

Outline the high-level journey for creating a BrainDrive plugin.

Recommended structure:

- **What You’ll Build** – a short value statement or demo link.
- **Environment Setup** – summarize the tooling and link to GitHub instructions.
- **Rapid Iteration Loop** – describe the steps developers should repeat, referencing training pages or videos.
- **Where to Go Next** – point to GitHub issues, discussions, or advanced docs.

Feel free to embed short clips or diagrams that make the workflow clear at a glance.
