# Roadmap Overview

Use this page to communicate what’s happening now, what’s next, and where contributors can help.

Consider covering:

- **Current Focus** – top initiatives with one-sentence summaries.
- **Upcoming Milestones** – the next few releases or objectives with target dates or quarters.
- **Ways to Contribute** – link to GitHub project boards, issues, or community chats.
- **Change Log Highlights** – spotlight major releases and link to release notes in GitHub.

Keep the narrative outcome-oriented so readers understand priorities without diving into implementation specifics.
