# BrainDrive Core Overview

This space is reserved for a concise orientation to the BrainDrive Core experience.

Use this page to outline what the platform includes, what outcomes readers can expect, and leave links to any deep-dive resources that live in GitHub.

> Tip: keep this page high levelâ€”describe goals, workflows, and how to get started without duplicating technical docs.

Next steps you might capture here:

- A short intro video or gif
- Links to GitHub repos or READMEs with technical details
