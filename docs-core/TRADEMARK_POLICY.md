# BrainDrive Trademark Policy

_Last updated: [5/18/25]_

## Protecting Our Promise

BrainDrive is a registered trademark of BrainDrive LLC. This policy exists to protect the integrity of our brand while supporting an open ecosystem.

### Why We Have a Trademark Policy

BrainDrive is open-source and built around freedom. But we also want the BrainDrive name to stand for something specific: a system you own, control, and benefit from.

This policy ensures that when people see “BrainDrive,” they’re not misled. You can build with it, monetize it, and say you're powered by it — you just can’t pretend to be it.

- You’re free to build.
- You’re free to monetize.
- You’re free to say you're powered by BrainDrive.

You just can’t pretend to be BrainDrive.

## Policy Updates
