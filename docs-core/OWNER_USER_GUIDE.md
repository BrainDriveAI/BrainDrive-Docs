BrainDrive is your open-source, self-hosted ChatGPT alternative that's easy to use and build on.

The 4 pillars of BrainDrive:

1. Ownership — You control your AI system, data, and created value
2. Freedom — Fully customizable and portable, with no Big Tech restrictions
3. Empowerment — Simple to use and build on, with supportive community
4. Sustainability — Lean core with a thriving plugin ecosystem and sustainable revenue model

Think WordPress for AI: Install BrainDrive-Core, then add or develop plugins to rapidly deploy AI-powered features.

Every BrainDrive owner receives:

1. A web‑based Chat interface for interacting with AI models

2. A built‑in Plugin Manager to install/manage extensions

 ![BrainDrive Plugin Manager Screenshot](/static/img/screenshots/plugin-manager.png)

3. A Page Builder for creating custom UIs without code

  ![BrainDrive Page Builder Screenshot](/static/img/screenshots/Page-Builder.png)
  
 4. Example plugins, tutorials, and developer resources

Host your BrainDrive locally on your computer, or on the cloud host of your choice. No Big-Tech lockin. 

### Your BrainDrive has a modular, plugin based architecture comprised of:

#### Core System (BrainDrive‑Core repository)

Provides the primary UI (chat, page builder, etc.) and backend services (user management, plugin APIs, conversation storage, etc.)

* **Frontend:** React + TypeScript web application
* **Backend:** Python FastAPI server with a SQLite database (default)

#### Plugin Ecosystem (Seperate repositories)

* Each plugin is a separate module (its own repository) that can be added dynamically.
* Uses Webpack Module Federation to load frontend plugins at runtime.
* A standardized Lifecycle Manager (Python) to integrate backend/installation logic.
* Plugins communicate with the core through well‑defined Service Bridges.
* Decoupled design allows customizing/extending BrainDrive without modifying core; update core/plugins independently.

## Quick Start Installation

**Note**: A one-click installer is planned for v1.0. For now, follow the developer-friendly [install guide here](https://braindriveai.github.io/BrainDrive-Docs/core/INSTALL).

## Setting Up Your First AI Model

BrainDrive supports both local and API-based AI providers, giving you complete flexibility over your AI experience.

### Option A: Local Models via BrainDrive's Ollama Plugin

For complete privacy, run models locally using Ollama or similar providers. BrainDrive comes with an Ollama Plugin as a default, which you can choose to use or easily delete from your BrainDrive. 

To use the Ollama Plugin to run local AI models:

1. Install Ollama from Ollama.com
3. Go to BrainDrive Settings & Install Your Preferred Model(s):

![BrainDrive Ollama Settings Page](/static/img/screenshots/ollama-settings-screebshot.png)

4. Chat Locally — All conversations stay on your machine:

![chatting with an Ollama model in BrainDrive](/static/img/screenshots/choosing-a-model.png)

### Option B: API-Based Models via BrainDrive's OpenRouter Plugin:

For those that want the speed and power of hosted models, BrainDrive's OpenRouter plugin offers the ability to serve hundreds of models via their API. The OpenRouter plugin comes with your BrainDrive by default, and can be easily removed for those that do not want it. 

To use OpenRouter models in your BrainDrive:

1. Signup at OpenRouter.com
2. Generate an OpenRouter API Key
![OpenRouter API key generation](/static/img/screenshots/openrouter-api-keys-page.png)
3. Add in Settings → AI Providers 
   * Enter your API key  
 ![Enter your API key](/static/img/screenshots/adding-openrouter-api-key-to-braindrive.png)
4. Now your models will show in the model dropdown on your AI Chat Page

### Option C: Build Your Own Model Serving Plugin for the provider of your choice. 

* Use the BrainDrive Ollama plugin as a template for building another local model serving plugin for the provider of your choice. 
* Use the BrainDrive OpenRouter plugin as a template for building another API model serving plugin for the provider of your choice.
* Keep your plugin private or share with the BrainDrive community via the plugin marketplace.

1. **Find a Plugin**: Browse community recommendations or GitHub  
2. **Get the URL**: Copy the plugin's GitHub repository URL  
3. **Install**: Plugin Manager → Install Plugin → Paste URL → Confirm  
4. **Use Components**: New components appear immediately in the Page Builder
