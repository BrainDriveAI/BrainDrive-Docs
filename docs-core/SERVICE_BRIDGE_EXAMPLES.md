# Service Bridges Overview & Examples

Plugins communicate through standardized bridges, not direct calls. This means:

- ‚úÖ No plugin dependencies or conflicts
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes when core updates
- ‚úÖ No intimate system knowledge needed

Designed to save you 90% of typical dev time.

> **Learn by doing**: 

Each service bridge has working examples with visual demonstrations and full documentation. Install them, interact with them, and copy the proven patterns.
