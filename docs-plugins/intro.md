# BrainDrive Plugins Intro

BrainDrive‚Äôs modular, plugin‚Äëbased architecture makes it easy to add features, integrate services, and build unique workflows. Think WordPress but for AI: install BrainDrive‚ÄëCore ‚Üí add your plugin ‚Üí ship your AI‚Äëpowered feature.

With BrainDrive Plugins:

- Anyone can build AI applications without reinventing core infrastructure
- Creators own their work instead of being locked into Big Tech platforms
- Innovation happens at the edges through community‚Äëdriven plugins
- Value flows to builders rather than platform monopolies

Plugins are like LEGO blocks:

- Use existing blocks (install community plugins)
- Create new blocks (build your own plugins)
- Combine blocks (multiple plugins working together)
- Share blocks (distribute via marketplace or independently)

## Architecture Overview

- BrainDrive‚ÄëCore: authentication, model access, UI framework, settings, and service bridges for decoupled, version‚Äëresilient plugin‚Äëto‚Äëcore communication
- Plugins: your unique functionality, built with React + TypeScript
- Plugin Manager: 1‚Äëclick Install / Update / Delete via the UI‚Äîno terminal required
- Page Builder: WYSIWYG editor for arranging plugins into custom interfaces

## Experience the Workflow

### 1. Get the Template (30 seconds)

```
git clone https://github.com/BrainDriveAI/BrainDrive-PluginTemplate.git
cd BrainDrive-PluginTemplate
```

### 2. Install & See It Live (2 minutes)

- Open BrainDrive ‚Üí Plugin Manager
- Click ‚ÄúInstall Plugins‚Äù and install the template via GitHub URL
- Open Page Builder (left‚Äëhand menu), select the plugin template, and drop it on a page
- You now have a live plugin

### 3. Make It Yours (1 minute)

- Change "Plugin Template" to "My First Plugin" in your IDE
- Build and refresh
- See your change instantly

### 4. Add Real Functionality (2 minutes)

- Use the API Service Bridge to fetch live data (crypto prices, weather, etc.)
- Add a 30‚Äësecond refresh timer
- Style with React + TypeScript

That‚Äôs it. You‚Äôve built, customized, and deployed a working AI plugin in 5 minutes.
