# Documentation Style Guide

## Tone and Voice

Write in the second person ("you") using active voice. Keep sentences short and clear. Assume the reader has basic technical knowledge but may be new to BrainDrive. Avoid jargon unless defined in the glossary.

## Structure

- Start with a brief introduction summarizing the goal of the page.
- Use headings and subheadings to break content into digestible sections.
- For howâ€‘to guides, include prerequisites, steps as an ordered list, and expected outcomes.
- Provide code blocks with comments where appropriate.
- Use tables for parameters, flags or configuration fields; avoid long sentences inside tables.

## Formatting

- Use Markdown fenced code blocks with language identifiers (e.g., ` ```bash`, ` ```python`).
- Include frontmatter at the top of every page as defined in the templates.
- Link to related pages using relative links when possible.
- Cite external sources when necessary, but prefer internal docs.
