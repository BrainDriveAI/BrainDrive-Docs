# Audience

The documentation serves three primary personas:

- **Builders**: Developers or hobbyists integrating BrainDrive into their projects. They need clear installation instructions, API references and troubleshooting guides.
- **Owners**: Users who deploy prebuilt BrainDrive products. They need highâ€‘level overviews, simple configuration guidance and upgrade information.
- **Admins**: People maintaining and operating BrainDrive installations at scale. They need operational guides, configuration details and security practices.

Write content at a technical level appropriate for each persona. Aim for a friendly, concise tone and explain terminology when first introduced.
