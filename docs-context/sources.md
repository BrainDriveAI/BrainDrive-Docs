# Sources of Truth

List of canonical sources that documentation should derive from:

- **Core README** — high‑level description, installation and configuration. See [README](https://github.com/BrainDriveAI/BrainDrive-Core/README.md).
- **API Reference** — public APIs and command‑line flags. See [API.md](https://github.com/BrainDriveAI/BrainDrive-Core/docs/API.md).
- **Documentation Plan** — the design and structure of this documentation ecosystem. See [Documentation Plan](Documentation%20Plan.md).
- **System PDF** — architecture and hardware specifications. See *BrainDrive – Self‑Hosted AI Platform (Full Context).pdf*.
- **Docs Site** — the rendered documentation site for how‑to guides and conceptual articles. See [BrainDrive Docs](https://braindriveai.github.io/BrainDrive-Docs/).

These sources are considered the single source of truth; documentation should mirror them and not conflict. When in doubt, consult these first.
