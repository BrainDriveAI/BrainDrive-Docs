# Update Policy

Documentation should be updated whenever:

- Public APIs change or new APIs are added.
- Configuration flags, commandâ€‘line options or default values change.
- Hardware components or supported platforms change.
- User workflows or installation procedures change.
- Releases are published.

Every pull request should indicate whether it affects documentation. If an update is needed, open a corresponding documentation issue tagged `docs-needed`. Owners should review changes within three working days. All pages include a `last_verified` field; verify and update this field when reviewing documentation.
