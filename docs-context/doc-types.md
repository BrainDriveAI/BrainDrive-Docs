# Documentation Types

BrainDrive documentation uses four primary types of content:

- **How‑to Guides**: Step‑by‑step instructions that help users accomplish a specific task. These guides should be written in imperative style, list prerequisites and define success criteria.
- **Concepts**: Explanations of key ideas, architectures or workflows. Concepts provide background knowledge but do not include step‑by‑step instructions.
- **Reference**: Technical specifications, APIs, configuration options and command‑line flags. Reference documents should be exhaustive and authoritative.
- **Troubleshooting**: Guides that help users diagnose and resolve issues. These documents should list symptoms, possible causes and resolutions.

Use the appropriate template for each doc type and include the required frontmatter.
