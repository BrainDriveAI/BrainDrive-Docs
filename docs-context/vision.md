# BrainDrive Vision

BrainDrive is an open‑source self‑hosted AI platform for autonomous driving and robotics. It combines modular software with hardware to enable developers and hobbyists to build, train and deploy intelligent vehicles and machines. Our goal is to democratize autonomy by providing accessible tools, clear documentation and an active community.

This document outlines the long‑term vision for BrainDrive and guides contributors on how we expect the documentation to evolve alongside the product.
