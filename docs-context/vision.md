# BrainDrive Vision

A world where everyone is an owner of their own AI system, instead of a user of Big Tech's AI systems. 

**Tagline:** Your AI. Your Rules.  
**Mission:** Make it easy to build, control, and benefit from your own AI system.

## 1) What is BrainDrive?
BrainDrive is a self-hosted, open-source AI platform that lets individuals **own**, **control**, and **benefit** from their AI. It’s modular and plugin-based—no vendor lock-ins, no data extraction.

## 2) Core Values (Non-negotiables)
1. **Ownership** — You own the system, data, and value you create.  
2. **Freedom** — MIT-licensed, customizable, portable, and forkable.  
3. **Empowerment** — Simple setup, approachable docs, community help.  
4. **Sustainability** — A lean core and value-aligned ecosystem that can thrive long-term.

## 3) Who BrainDrive Serves
- **Owners:** Not “users.” You decide models, hosting, and data flows; you keep the value.  
- **Builders:** Devs/tinkerers extending BrainDrive with plugins, pages, and workflows—permissionless by design.  
- **Entrepreneurs:** People turning their BrainDrive into income via tools, services, automations, and content.

## 4) The Problem We Solve
Corporate AI centralizes control: data extraction, lock-ins, shifting terms, and constrained capabilities. That erodes privacy, freedom, and creator upside.

**Corporate AI ownership → exploitation and lost agency.**  
**Personal AI ownership → freedom and empowerment.**

## 5) Our Solution
- **Self-hosted & open** — You can run it locally or in the cloud, swap parts, and fork anytime.  
- **Modular & extensible** — A plugin architecture for features, models, and workflows.  
- **Monetization-friendly** — Keep what you earn; no rent-seeking middle layer.

## 6) Vision for the Future
- AI is everywhere—but **you** own yours.  
- Innovation grows at the edges (owners/builders), not just in labs.  
- Value flows to creators and communities.  
- Open ecosystems outcompete walled gardens on speed and trust.

## 7) Current Status (living section)
Open beta **v0.6.x** with core features (plugin manager, page builder, chat). Focus: polish dev experience, grow community, and stabilize for **v1.0**.

## 8) How AIs Should Help (Collaboration Directives)
When you (the AI) assist BrainDrive:
- **Default to ownership-preserving choices.** Prefer self-hosted, open-source, and exportable solutions.  
- **Prefer plugins over core edits.** Recommend modular integrations first.  
- **Minimize lock-in.** Always include a migration path or exit strategy.  
- **Surface trade-offs.** Note cost, latency, privacy, and maintainability.  
- **Guard privacy.** Don’t propose sending sensitive data to closed services without a strong, explicit reason.  
- **Accelerate builders.** Provide examples, checklists, and minimal viable steps to ship.

## 9) Decision Heuristics (Use These Rules of Thumb)
- **Owner lens first:** Does this keep the owner in control? If not, find an alternative.  
- **Modularity bias:** If it can be a plugin, it should be.  
- **Sustainability check:** Favor options that reduce long-term maintenance and dependency risk.  
- **Community leverage:** Prefer patterns others can reuse (docs, templates, examples).  
- **Clarity > cleverness:** Simple, well-documented solutions beat complex ones.

## 10) Success Signals
- More **Owners** running self-hosted BrainDrives.  
- More **Builders** shipping useful plugins/workflows, with fast time-to-first-ship.  
- More **Entrepreneurs** earning directly from their BrainDrives.  
- Healthy ecosystem metrics: fork-ability, contributor growth, plugin diversity.

## 11) Community & Ecosystem
We’re building a permissionless economy around personal AI: shared knowledge, open contribution, transparent governance patterns, and community-led momentum. Success is measured by **owner empowerment**, not corporate profits.

## 12) Out-of-Bounds (Non-Goals)
- Walled gardens, rent extraction, or anti-fork tactics.  
- Recommendations that centralize control or hide data flows.  
- “Dark patterns” that trade short-term growth for owner freedom.

## 13) Quick AI Checklist (keep this at the end)
- [ ] Did I recommend an option that preserves ownership, privacy, and exit paths?  
- [ ] Is my solution modular (plugin-first) and minimally coupled to core?  
- [ ] Did I provide a concise, shippable next step (code/example/checklist)?  
- [ ] Did I call out trade-offs (cost/latency/quality/maintenance)?  
- [ ] Did I reference or propose improvements to our docs/templates?
